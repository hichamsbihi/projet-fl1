/*********************************************** IMPORTANT TO READ ***************************************************
 * In this generic component we can add a decision maker to connect the router switch to the right components whom the connected user has access to.
 * Until now we have just one main component from which the user can upload his files.
 * the Navbar component will stay static and of course if any changes have to be done to the navbar, the component in ../NavBar/AdminNavBar is the right place.
 * Benefits of this decorator: A simple user does not have the access to Admin components even if he tries to get access by their urls directly.
 * To add other user rules, we need just to add their own home component who master the switchs.
